This project implements Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) using 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for grayscale images. It performs wavelet decomposition, visualizes approximation and detail coefficients at multiple levels, and extracts statistical features from each sub-band.  The program is designed for image processing, texture analysis
